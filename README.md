# A repository of my outputs from the course Machine Learning A-Z from Udemy

### **Start Date**: September 14, 2024

### **End Date**: Pending

Note: I started on September 14, 2024 but I was inconsistent and only learned when I felt like it. Not to mention the heavy workloads from school during that time.
I went on hiatus during the Multiple Linear Regression section of the course, which was on October 15, 2024.

When the 2025 New Year hit, I told myself that I'm going to lock-in. And I did (I think so, as of writing this). Starting from January 10, I continued where I left off, never stopping
and maintaining a streak of learning the course everyday.
